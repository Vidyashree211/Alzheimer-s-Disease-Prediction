# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Prediction
Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of dementia, leading to severe cognitive decline and memory loss. Early detection is essential for managing this condition effectively. In this study, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to predict the onset of Alzheimer's using extensive patient health data. We applied several classification methods, including Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bagging, and Boosting. By combining these approaches, especially focusing on boosting techniques, we aim to improve prediction accuracy. Our results, illustrated through bar graphs, demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in early diagnosis and risk assessment. The comprehensive analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of each model, offering a detailed comparison of their performance.
